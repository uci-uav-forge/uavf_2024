    IMO, it's not good practice to have a utils module, especially considering this function only has one caller.

    Args:
        img (np.ndarray): Color, full-resolution input image in the format (height, width, channels)
        tile_size (int): Width/height of each tile
        min_overlap (int, optional): Number of pixels that each tile overlaps with its neighbors. Defaults to 0.

    Yields:
        Generator[Tile, None, None]: Generator that yields each tile
